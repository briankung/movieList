# OMDB Movie Search in React.js

This is a simple React app that lets you search Open Movie Database for movie titles. It's heavily based on the [React.js tutorial.](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)

All the dependencies are included in `lib`:

- [Skeleton.css](http://getskeleton.com/)
- [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) & JSX Transformer
